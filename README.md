# ItzSwirlz's Clone Hero Charts

This is where I store all my charts for Clone Hero. VCS is weird, and I will have a public google drive that people can download from but git allows me to be more transparent in the songs I'm working on, and allows for people to update easier by doing 'git pull' - they can clone this repo and then periodically git pull when I release a new chart. Also, others can playtest
